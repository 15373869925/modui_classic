#### Options ####
Click the M above the backpack button (bottom-right of the main actionbar) to open theme and display options. modui is designed to be modular and the different elements of the UI can be turned on and off.

#### FAQ ####
Q: I'm getting an error that says something about MODUI_VAR.

A: try reloading the UI (type: _/rl_) and then deleting your cache before making an issue, particularly if you've recently used an older version of modui.



Q: The UI won't load in my game!

A: Make sure you're putting the directory in _WoW/Classic/Interface/AddOns/_, then rename the folder from *modui_classic-master* to *modui_classic*.

#### To-do ####
- Combat Text
- PvP and Battleground support.
- Raid Frames (?)
- Other stuff i forgot about since I last worked on this thing.
